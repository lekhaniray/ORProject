  <h3>Rules</h3>
  The rules of the game are simple – the game is played in 24 rounds, in every round of the game you
					perform the following four steps:
					</p><ul>
						<li>
							<b>Check deliveries.</b> Check how many units of beer are being delivered to you from your <span>wholesaler.</span>
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Check orders.</b> Check how many units of beer your <span>customers have</span> ordered.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Deliver beer.</b> Deliver as much beer as you can to satisfy demand – in the game, this step will be performed for you automatically.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Make order decision.</b> Decide how many units of beer you need to order from your <span>wholesaler</span> to keep your inventory stocked up and to ensure you have enough beer to meet future demands.
						</li>
					</ul>
				<p>

			</p>
</div>

<div id="Objectives" class="tabcontent">
  <p>
					<span>Objective</span>
					</p><ul>
						<li>
							<b>Keep your inventory steady</b> You need to keep your inventory steady to ensure you can deal with fluctuations in demand. Try to reach an inventory target of <b>250</b> by the end of the game.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Keep your cost down</b> Both excess inventory and backorders increase your cost. Keep your total cost below <b>$8.300</b>.
						</li>
						<li bptk-unless="game.isMultiplayer">
							<b>Keep overall cost down</b> Excessive order behaviour on your part will lead to shocks in the supply chain, which increase overall supply chain cost. Ensure that the total cost of the supply chain remains below <b>$29.300</b>.
						</li>
					</ul>
				<p></p>
</div>

<div id="Pitfalls" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>Pitfalls</h3>
  <p><p>There are some pitfalls that you need to be aware of during the game:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>Delays.</b> Your demands for beer may not be fulfilled immediately – your supplier may also be out of stock and will then have to pass is own order up the supply chain.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Shocks.</b> Excessive order behaviour may lead to shocks in the supply line, which increases the overall supply chain cost.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Inventory Costs.</b> If you order to many units of beer, your inventory costs will rise, because you will need more people to handle the beer and more storage space. The target level of beer units in your inventory is 400 units. Inventory cost you <i class="fa fa-usd"></i><b>{{game.simulator.lastresult.performanceControlling▸costPerItemInInventory}}</b>
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Backorder Costs</b> If you order to few units of beer, you may not be able to supply your customer with enough beer. Backorders cost you <i class="fa fa-usd">
					</i><b>{{game.simulator.lastresult.performanceControlling▸costPerItemInBackorder}}</b> per unit.
					</li>

				</ul>
			<p>
					Initially the system is in a steady state - but the beer you are selling has suddently become popular among students, so the demand may suddenly change...

<div id="Intresting_Facts" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>Intresting_Facts</h3>
  <p>Some interesting facts about the Beer Game:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						The Beer Game was developed in the 1960s at MIT to illustrate how difficult it is to manage dynamic systems.
					</li>
					<li>
						The game became well known in the 1990s after Peter Senge's description of it in his world-wide best-selling book "The Fifth Discipline".
					</li>
					<li bptk-unless="game.isMultiplayer">
						The Beer Game is traditionally played with four players (brewery, distributor, wholesaler, retailer) either as a board game or using computers. In this single player edition, the order decisions of the brewery, the distributor and the wholesaler are made using an order policy implemented using System Dynamics.
					</li>
					<li bptk-unless="game.isMultiplayer">
						The game runs entirely in your browser, no data is transmitted to our web-server.
